# One-Setting-Server

## Introduction
OSS is an auto-setting scripts for linux servers by one command. 

You can use the hsell script to configure the basic environment easily and you don't have to spend time before the screen because the script does everything for you. 

***Tip:*** It is better for you to start and enable ssh server before launch the script, because ssh is supposed to installed in the installation of system. When you isntall the server, please select proper mirror for the software source to get a better experience of downloading. These scripts do their jobs in one command and never do extra operation when them are running unless the process stops for bugs. If you find the status of process is slow, the most possible reason is your network.
